# Backpack Price Prediction using XGBoost

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of backpacks using the **XGBoost** machine learning algorithm. By leveraging a dataset containing various backpack attributes, we apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to build an accurate predictive model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution, correlations, and key insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting technique for regression.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model for better predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

## Dataset
The dataset consists of backpack listings with the following key features:
- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the backpack
- **Material**: Fabric or leather used
- **Size & Capacity**: Dimensions and volume
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Customer feedback
- **Other Features**: Compartments, color, and additional functionalities


## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Perform **EDA** to gain insights.
3. Train and optimize the **XGBoost model**.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
5. Use the trained model for price predictions.

## Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in predicting backpack prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of **XGBoost** in handling structured data with non-linear relationships.
